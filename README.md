# About

A starter project to help save time when creating a new mod. The project structure tries to follow the official Necesse as much as possible, without becoming redundnant. Folders have mostly only been provided for examples, but where new things would go should hopefully make sense. 

The mod also includes register methods for **most** things you'd want to register, ordered as recommended by the Necesse developer. It is recommended to register things exclusively in the created registrars.
